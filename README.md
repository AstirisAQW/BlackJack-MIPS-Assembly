# Project Description
The provided program is a MIPS assembly language code designed to simulate a simplified version of the Blackjack card game.

The purpose of this program is to:
1. Allow the dealer and the player to draw cards.
2. Calculate the scores for both the dealer and the player.
3. Let the player decide whether to "Hit" (draw another card) or "Stay" (stop drawing cards).
4. Determine the winner based on the scores and display the result.

The program takes user input using the MIPS system call li $v0, 5 and syscall, which reads an integer from the user to determine whether they want to "Hit" or "Stay".
